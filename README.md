# DataFitter
This project automatically generates polynomials to fit a set of points.

To run the program, go to the root directory and type (without quotations) "java -cp bin DataFitter"

To add a point to the set, right click anywhere on the screen

To remove a point from the set, right click that point

Points can be dragged around; the polynomial will automatically update.
